            <h1 className="w-[100%] text-center text-[30px] font-extrabold underline">Welcome to Travel Blogs</h1>

                <p className='font-extrabold'>  Choosing a destination for your next vacation can be overwhelming, with many places to visit.
                    Fortunately for you, travel bloggers and writers have seen a lot of places, and if someone can
                    recommend you a great vacation spot – they can. All you have to do is read up on their experiences,
                    narrow down your choices, and from there on, you might as well spin the wheel and go wherever it takes you.</p>
                <h2 className="text-[24px] font-black">2.Expenses:</h2>
                <p className='font-extrabold '> Expense is a significant factor when traveling, especially if you re going abroad.
                    You could easily miscalculate your budget if you dont factor everything in. For instance,
                    you ll include food, beverages, going to different locations, etc. But maybe, you forget to
                    factor in traveling expenses like a taxi, which could easily add up to several hundred bucks
                    if you plan on moving around a lot. On the other hand, if you read the best travel blog,
                    you can be sure they re going to talk about all that stuff so that when it is time for you
                    to prepare – you ll be ready.</p>
                <h2 className="text-[24px] font-black">3.Get to Know About Local Culture:</h2>
                <p className='font-extrabold'>One of the most underrated advantages of reading travel blogs is learning about your destination by reading other people s travel experiences. It might seem odd to read about other people s vacations to the same destination. But by reading about places you might want to visit or things you might want to do, you ll start learning about the culture and history of the place you re visiting. Knowing a little about the culture of the place you intend to visit might be really beneficial. Travel bloggers are already familiar with it, and they can assist you in learning it as well. Many new visitors, for example, are unfamiliar with the tipping system in the United States and will not tip the waiters who rely on it. You can ensure that your stay is enjoyable wherever you go by learning about nuances like that one.</p>
                <h2 className="text-[24px] font-black">4.Free and Unbiased Opinion:</h2>
                <p className='font-extrabold'>What s the best part of it all? Its entirely free. These people will give their honest opinions without expecting anything in return. And its not like they re just going to show off their images. No. They ll give you a lot of good advice on topics you didn t even realise you needed guidance on. So, go for it. It s utterly free counsel. And these days, that isn t easy to come by.</p>
                <h2 className="text-[24px] font-black">4.Fill Your Stomach:</h2>
                <p className='font-extrabold'> Food is what makes a journey. Explore regional specialties. If you want to explore your hidden corners of the world and discover unique cuisines, consider exploring local food. Travel blogs are an excellent way for travelers to connect and learn about the regional cuisines and must-visit places to eat for a beautiful travel experience.</p>
                <h2 className="text-[24px] font-black text-center mt-5 underline">Conclusion</h2>
